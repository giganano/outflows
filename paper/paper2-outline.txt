1. 	Radial flow schematic

2.	Top row of panels: velocity profiles as functions of radius
		Left: \beta_\phi,out = 0 with \eta ~ e^R, \eta = 1, \eta = 0
		Middle: \beta_\phi,out = 1 with \eta ~ e^R, \eta = 1, \eta = 0
		Right: \eta = 0 with \beta_\phi,out varying with radius

	Bottom row of panels:
		Left: Different rotational velocity assumptions for accreting material
		Right: Observed velocity distribution from Di Teodoro & Peek (2021).

	Take-away: Choice of \eta and \beta_\phi,out significantly more important
		than choice of \beta_\phi,in, because \eta determines the speed of the
		baryon cycle overall, which in turns sets the rate of angular momentum
		exchange.

	Use fiducial SFH at the present day to compute velocity profiles, simply
	forward referencing that discussion in a subsequent section. This figure
	should appear probably in section 2.2, which describes the radial flow
	coefficients -- go ahead and plug in v_r from 2.1 and show differential
	equation for v_r as function of radius in 2.2.

3. Fiducial GCE model mosaic

	- SFR as function of time at 3 radii
	- IFR as function of time at same radii
	- [O/H] vs. time at same radii
	- [O/H] vs. radius at snapshots
	- radial velocity profiles at snapshots
	- \eta, \mu_g, \mu_x vs. radius at snapshots

	Take-away: point is to show-case the evolution of the fiducial model.

4. [O/H] vs. radius at present-day for different choices of R_\eta.

	Take-away: To first order, R_\eta sets the slope of the gradient.

5. [O/H] vs. time at R = 8 kpc and [O/H] vs. radius at snapshots for the
	fiducial model and one choice of lower yields and \eta.

	Extras to add onto the left-panel:
		- A variant where the infall metallicity is zero.
		- A variant where all SN yields rise toward low metallicity -> hasten
			the approach to equilibrium?
		- Overlay [O/H] vs. age at 8 kpc from linear regressions to APOGEE
			sample in paper 1 (transparent background line)

	Take-away: Models with long depletion times have slow baryon cycles and a
	slow approach to equilibrium, whereas models with short depletion times
	have fast baryon cycles and a quick approach to equilibrium. Sinks are required in order for the approach to equilibrium to happen within the
	first ~few Gyr of the disk lifetime.

	Combined with Fig. 4: The slope of the equlibrium gradient and the
	timescale on which it is reached are dictated by R_\eta and \eta_\odot.
	Our results indicate that R_\eta ~ 3-4 kpc with \eta > ~0.6 is required to
	explain the gradient in the MW.

	Discuss how similar effects arise when we force the CGM metallicity to
	zero (but does having it grow with time mean that the approach to
	equilibrium is too slow and we need higher yields and \eta's?)

6. [O/H] vs. radius at snapshots. Put population-averaged gradient measurements
	from APOGEE as transparent points in the background

	Top-row of panels has \beta_\phi,out = 0
	Bottom-row of panels has \beta_\phi,out = 1

	- Left: \eta ~ e^R with R_\eta = 3 kpc and \eta_\odot = 0.6 (fiducial)
	- Mid-left: \eta = 1 at all radii
	- Right: \eta = 0 at all radii

	Take-away: some models work, some don't. The ones that do have \eta ~ e^R.

7. \Gamma decomposition for each model in the previous figure at the final
	timestep.

	Take-away: the detailed physics of what drives the gradient differs based
	on the details of the angular momentum exchange. We selected the fiducial
	model parameters because they seem the most phyiscal for reasons.

8. \eta and \mu_O vs. radius for \beta_\phi,out = 0 and 1.

	Take-away: Even in the \beta_\phi,out = 0 case, the outflow still plays
	an extremely key role in setting the equilibrium abundance. \Gamma becomes
	determined entirely by \Gamma_\star, but it is ultimately \eta which makes
	the velocities fast enough to have substantial \Gamma_\star in the first
	place.

9. Outer-burst GCE model mosaic

	- Same panels as fiducial model mosaic, but for snapshots in the lower
	panels, choose those that occur near the burst. Swap out \eta, \mu_x, and
	\mu_g as a function of radius for gradient slope as a function of radius.

	Take-away: point is to show-case the evolution of the outer-burst model.

10. [O/H]_burst - [O/H]_risefall at R = 4 (left), 8 (middle), 12 (right) kpc
	vs. time.

	- Look at models with \eta ~ e^R, \eta = 1, and \eta = 0, each with and
		without radial gas flows. Show-case the ones that are interesting.

	Take-away: In the equilibrium model, a major merger induces an accretion
		driven starburst, which acts as a perturbation from the equilibrium
		state that relaxes on ~Gyr timescales.

11. Show models in which R_\eta mildly increases (left) and decreases (right)
	with time.

	Take-away: this choice causes the gradient to steepen (left) or flatten
	(right) with time, which could coincide with time-evolution in the galaxy's
	properties with age, but at fixed gradient normalization.






**Note**: Copy the outerburst model with the fiducial parameter choice and one
	of the time-evolving R_\eta models over to the comparison to Lu et al.
	(2022) in paper 1.
